A quick project involving a basaic encoder/decoder transormer. 

Due to a divorce, I am forced to save as much $$ I can. As a result I can't use slick GPU's that would make debugging the logic error in my transofmrer a lot faster. I'll get back to fixing this eventually, my completionist side of me says that I must.
